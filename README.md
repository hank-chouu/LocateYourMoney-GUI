# LocateYourMoney-GUI
### Abstract
This is a small project for my 2021/2022 winter vacation, to keep track of my accounts' balance every day and give some charts to have a better understanding about how my money is distributed. 
### GUI
This repository is the part of creating a GUI, where user can check their balances, add more bank or crypto accounts or just delete it, if they want to.
This is made out of python flask module, with web templates of bootstrap, connecting to one of my gdrive folder(where I store user information and logs).
### Things not accomplished
The main goal is to deploy on a cloud server. I tried to deploy on GCP, sometimes it worked with a little css malfunctioning or failure of on-the-fly images creating, but currently it is not working. The app is located at:
